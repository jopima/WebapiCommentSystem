# Discussion Forum built with Asp.Net web api, backbone.js, require.js and SQL Server Compact edition
This sample was inspired by the sample [backbone-relational tutorial] (http://antoviaque.org/docs/tutorials/backbone-relational-tutorial/). 
The original sample used backbone relational, backbone.js, node.js, MongoDB,restify. I wanted to implement the same sample using .Net technologies,
i stripped out node.js, mongoDB, even backbone relational itself, don't get me wrong for stripping out backbone relational, it is a powerful plugin, 
i just thought you could achieve simillar behaviour without using an extra backbone plugin. 

The sample supports post creation, comment addition, pagination in the simplest way posimble using the core backbone.js implementation. 

If your like me, you enjoy your .Net and the power of open source. Show me how to improve it.
